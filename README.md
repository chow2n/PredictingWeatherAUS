# PredictingWeatherAUS

In this project, I use data mining tools in Python to create a model for predicting the weather in Australia. Everything in the code is annotated to demonstrate the purpose of each line. I preprocessed the data using NumPy and Pandas and I created a Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network model and used GridSearch to select the best parameters for each. In the end, I compared the accuracy and ROC curves of each model with the MatPlotLib library.
